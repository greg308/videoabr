title: Real-EVE: Real-time Edge-assist Video Enhancement for Joint Denoising and Super-resolution
---

<h1>Introduction and Motivation </h1>

<p> Real-time video applications have received much attention in recent years.  However, the perceived quality of real-time videos in many situations is far from ideal due to  two major obstacles: noise in the video frames caused by limited camera hardware and low resolution caused by bandwidth-limited networks. We propose a new Real-time Edge-assist Video Enhancement (Real-EVE) framework. Real-EVE includes two key designs: The video-enhancement deep neural network (VE-DNN), which jointly  eliminates noise and super-resolves videos in real time with a small inference delay; and the video-enhancement-aware adaptive bitrate streaming (VEA-ABR), which adapts sending rate in response to changing network conditions to optimize the video quality posterior to video enhancement.</p>
